GHOST (General meta-Heuristic Optimization Solving Toolkit) is a C++ library designed to help developers to model and implement optimization problem solving. It contains a meta-heuristic solver aiming to solve any kind of combinatorial and optimization real-time problems represented by a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP), a Constrained Optimization Problem (COP), a Error Function Constraint-based Satisfaction Problem (EF-CSP), or a Error Function-based Constrained Optimization Problem (EF-COP).
