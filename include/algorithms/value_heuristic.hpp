/*
 * GHOST (General meta-Heuristic Optimization Solving Tool) is a C++ framework
 * designed to help developers to model and implement optimization problem
 * solving. It contains a meta-heuristic solver aiming to solve any kind of
 * combinatorial and optimization real-time problems represented by a CSP/COP/EF-CSP/EF-COP. 
 *
 * First developed to solve game-related optimization problems, GHOST can be used for
 * any kind of applications where solving combinatorial and optimization problems. In
 * particular, it had been designed to be able to solve not-too-complex problem instances
 * within some milliseconds, making it very suitable for highly reactive or embedded systems.
 * Please visit https://github.com/richoux/GHOST for further information.
