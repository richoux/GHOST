/*
 * GHOST (General meta-Heuristic Optimization Solving Tool) is a C++ framework
 * designed to help developers to model and implement optimization problem
 * solving. It contains a meta-heuristic solver aiming to solve any kind of
 * combinatorial and optimization real-time problems represented by a CSP/COP/EF-CSP/EF-COP. 
 *
 * First developed to solve game-related optimization problems, GHOST can be used for
 * any kind of applications where solving combinatorial and optimization problems. In
 * particular, it had been designed to be able to solve not-too-complex problem instances
 * within some milliseconds, making it very suitable for highly reactive or embedded systems.

		/*!
		 * Pure virtual method to compute the error of the constraint regarding the values of
		 * variables given as input.
		 *
		 * This method is fundamental: as a predicate, it evalutes if the given values of 
		 * variables violate this contraint, and as an error function, it evaluates how much.\n
		 * Let's consider the following example to understand error functions: consider the
		 * contraint (x = y).\n
		 * If x = 42 and y = 42, then these values satify the contraint. The error is then 0.\n
		 * If x = 42 and y = 40, the constraint is not satified, but intuitively, we are closer
		 * to have a solution than with x = 42 and y = 10,000. Thus the error when y = 40 must
		 * be strictly lower than the error when y = 10,000.\n
		 * Thus, a required_error candidate for the contraint (x = y) could be the function |x-y|.
		 *
		 * This method MUST returns a value greater than or equals to 0.
		 *
		 * Users have the choice: while modeling CSP or COP problems, required_error must implement
		 * the logic of a predicate and should outputs 0 if current values of variables
		 * satisfy the user-defined constraint, and something strictly higher than 0 otherwise,
		 * like 1 for instance.
		 *
		 * While modeling EF-CSP/EF-COP problems, required_error needs to express an error function.
		 * It still must outputs 0 for satisfying values of variables, but must
		 * outputs a value strictly higher than 0 otherwise, such that the higher this value,
		 * the further current values of variables are from satisfying the user-defined constraint.
		 *
		 * Like any methods prefixed by 'required_', overriding this method is mandatory.
		 *
		 * \warning DO NOT implement any side effect in this method. It is called by the solver 
		 * to compute the constraint error but also for some inner mechanisms (such as error 
		 * simulations).
		 *
		 * \param variables a const reference of the vector of raw pointers to variables in the
		 * scope of the constraint. The solver is actually calling this method with the vector 
		 * of variables that has been given to the constructor.
		 * \return A **positive** double corresponding to the error of the constraint.
		 * Outputing 0 means that given variable values satisfy the constraint.
		 * \exception Throws an exception if the computed value is negative or is NaN.

		 * Virtual method to compute the difference, or delta, between the current error and
		 * the error of a candidate assignment.
		 *
		 * The current assignment, as well as its error, are automatically stored in the class
		 * Constraint. Giving a vector of variable indexes and their respective candidate value,
		 * this methods ouputs the difference between the error of the current assignment in
		 * 'variables' given as input and the error we would get if we assign new candidate values.
		 *
		 * The ouput can be negative, positive, or equals to 0. If the candidate error is strictly
		 * lower (then better) than the current error, the ouput is negative. If errors are the
		 * same, the ouputs equals to 0. Finally, if the candidate error is strictly higher
		 * (then worst) than the current error, the ouput is positive.
		 *
		 * For EF-CSP/EF-COP models, this method can be VERY important to have faster computation. 
		 * Although optional (the solver still works without it), we strongly advise users to define
		 * it properly, unless the overridden required_error method is trivial to compute.
		 * Having this method may make a big difference for the solver to quickly find better
		 * solutions. However, if the problem is modeled as an CSP/COP, users can just skip
		 * the implementation of this method.
