/*
 * GHOST (General meta-Heuristic Optimization Solving Tool) is a C++ framework
 * designed to help developers to model and implement optimization problem
 * solving. It contains a meta-heuristic solver aiming to solve any kind of
 * combinatorial and optimization real-time problems represented by a CSP/COP/EF-CSP/EF-COP. 
 *
 * First developed to solve game-related optimization problems, GHOST can be used for
 * any kind of applications where solving combinatorial and optimization problems. In
 * particular, it had been designed to be able to solve not-too-complex problem instances
 * within some milliseconds, making it very suitable for highly reactive or embedded systems.
 * Please visit https://github.com/richoux/GHOST for further information.

	 * This is the base class from which users need to derive their ModelBuilder class. 
	 *
	 * ghost::ModelBuilder cannot be directly used to encode user-defined model builder,
	 * since this is an abstract class. Users need to make their own derived model builder.
	 *
	 * Once users have written their own Constraint class(es), and eventually an Objective
	 * class and an AuxiliaryData class, they need to declare what their combinatorial
	 * problem is by:
	 * - declaring what the variables of the problem are, and what is their associated
	 * domain, i.e., what is the set of values each variable can take.
	 * - declaring what the constraints of the problem are, and what variables are in
	 * their scope.
	 * - for optimization problems, declaring what is the objective function to minimize or
	 * maximize.
	 * - eventually, declaring some auxiliary data to keep updated user-defined data
	 * structures while the solver is changing the value of variables.
	 *
	 * A user-defined ModelBuilder class is here to declare all elements above composing
	 * a problem instance.
